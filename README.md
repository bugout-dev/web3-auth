# web3login

This is a web3 authorization library. Use it to add web3 login on a Python API. JavaScript version is coming later.

### What it does
----

Web3login allows you to authenticate users by their Ethereum accounts. Currently we support MetaMask and weâ€™re planning to add support for WalletConnect.

It works by asking users to sign a message to log in:
